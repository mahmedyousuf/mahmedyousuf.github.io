I saw a video of Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam where a 8 year boy is asking question to him. The Boy asks what is the strength of India and what is the weakness of India?

Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reply kept me thinking what are our priorities in our life. It kept me in thinking to Rethink my priorities.

He replied that Indiaâ€™s biggest strength is our young generation and biggest weakness is nation without a vision.

We usually compare ourselves with India in different aspects but one key difference this that they have vision for their young generations , for nation and for self.

I believe, we have to ask these questions to ourselves that what is our vision for self, for family , for neighborhood , for country and for our young generation? We need to assess and revalidate our priorities and work on these visions.

There is a saying that it is better to stand and face right direction instead of running in wrong direction.
